# Getting Started with Create React App

📌 Description for README.md 

Single Page Application (SPA) Using React Props & React Router
📖 Overview
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using React.js, where different pages
(Home, About, and Contact) are displayed dynamically using React Router. The application  
demonstrates how to pass data via props, manage navigation efficiently, and create a modern, 
responsive UI.

🚀 Features
✅ React Router Implementation – Allows seamless navigation between multiple pages.
✅ Props Usage – Dynamically passes content (title & description) to pages.
✅ Reusable Components – A Page component is used to avoid redundancy.
✅ Fully Responsive UI – Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
